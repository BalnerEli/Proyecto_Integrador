# Spotify system

In this project it is intended to give a simulation to the system used by spotify.
Spotify has 2 types of audios: Songs and Podcasts. 
All audios have: ID, name, duration, views, likes, dislikes, comments, genre, and the rating of the users which is the percentage of likes in regard to the total of likes and dislikes.
Podcasts have episodes. All episodes show a resume of the episode.
Episodes belong to a Season. The season displays the number of episodes.

The song collection with its ID, name, duration, views, likes, dislikes, comments, genre, and the rating of the users.
